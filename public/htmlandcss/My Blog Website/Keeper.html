                    <strong>Make life secure, Unique, Tension-free, low memory consuming and Stop memorizing
                        Passwords</strong>
                    <hr>
                    As the world is growing and the internet is continuously developing which is also increasing the
                    security issues day by day. Many viruses/malware have created till now and many websites hacked. The
                    ratio of hacking increases every year. At the early ages of the internet, there are some of the
                    websites or applications available and now there is a huge amount of applications and websites
                    available on the internet we can’t imagine counting is impossible. Every single website or any
                    platform requires signup and wants the visitor or user to create an account. As data increases, it
                    raises the security issues related to the account.
                    Some of the questions raised in the current era. How can we secure our password? How to remember the
                    passwords? How to make them save from hacking? Is it safe to save a password using the password
                    manager?
                    Answer: The answer to all these questions is Yes, it is possible but how? Let’s further discuss it.
                    According to Google Security Survey“, 52 percent of the users use the same password in order to
                    create accounts on the internet.”
                    As everyone has to create accounts on too many websites or applications so people use the same easy
                    passwords to memorize them easily. Most of the hackers use brute-force algorithms(Bruteforce
                    attacks: Bruteforce attacks or algorithms are the attacks that users try different passwords again
                    and again until it gets the password). Easy passwords are easy to crack by brute-force attacks. And
                    if all the passwords are the same then by cracking one the hacker gets access to all the accounts.
                    But if the password changes for every site or becomes strong then it creates more tension and
                    increases memory usage as well as tension too. The solution is here <em> <strong> Password
                            Managers.</strong> </em>

                </p>
                <h3>What are Password Managers?

                </h3>
                <p> <dfn> Password managers</dfn> are the type of Softwares or programs that saves the passwords and
                    secure them from hacking as well as store all the password and make the owner retrieve the password
                    while accessing the application or website. Cybersecurity officers of this type of software take
                    care of this software and all the passwords are saved on a server vault behind the master password
                    which is completely encrypted.</p>
                <h3>Types of Password Managers:</h3>
                <h5> Desktop-Based:</h5>
                <p> <strong> <dfn> Desktop based software</dfn> </strong>are the type of software that stores the
                    password on the device. It doesn’t allow access from any other device and if all the data of the
                    device is removed the passwords remove as well.</p>

                <h5> Cloud-Based:</h5>
                <p> <strong> <dfn> Cloud-based password managers</dfn></strong> are the software that stores passwords
                    of the device make them store on the cloud. It allows access from any device user wants. As well all
                    the passwords are saved no matter data of the device removes. They all secured in the vault which is
                    secured by Advanced Encrypted Standard.</p>

                <h5> Single Sign-On(SSO):</h5>
                <p> <strong> <dfn>Single Sign-On(SSO)</dfn></strong> are the type of password managers which saves the
                    identity of users and for other forms or password they worked as a passport. They allow the user to
                    access all the other websites through single credentials. Basically password manager creates
                    different passwords for all the websites, but the user can access them through the password manager
                    using single credentials.
                </p>
                <h3>Benefits:</h3>
                <p> <strong> No need to memorize passwords:</strong> Password managers are mostly used to save
                    passwords. By saving the passwords there is no further need to memorize the passwords anymore. All
                    the passwords are saved on the cloud/device but not openly instead saved wholly encrypted. So it is
                    difficult to access these by any unknown person.

                    <br> <strong> Alert for a Phishing website:</strong> In today’s era most of the hackers use the
                    phishing method by creating fake webpages completely looks likes the original one and when the user
                    enters their credentials they get hacked. Password managers have an extension installed in the
                    user’s browser and alert the user from entering the credentials.

                    <br> <strong> Save time:</strong> If the user has installed the password managers in their browsers
                    then they save the credentials of every account user creates using that browser after the user’s
                    permission. In the case of long passwords, it is annoying to write long passwords again and again.
                    Instead, it is easy to manage passwords using password managers and enter the password on one click
                    and no need to memorize it.

                    <br> <strong>Sync all over the devices:</strong> The best benefit of the Cloud-based password
                    managers is they can allow the user to access them through any device all over the internet. When a
                    person saves a password in any device it saves on the cloud and sync to all the devices on which a
                    user is using the password manager.
                </p>
                <h3> <strong> Best Password Manager</strong></h3>
                <p>There are many password managers available but the most customize and optimize one is named <strong>
                        <cite> Keeper</cite></strong>. <strong> <cite> Keeper</cite></strong> is one of the <strong>
                        <cite> best passwords managers</cite></strong> with many options available. It has free as well
                    as premium service too. And the premium service is cheaper than Dashlane and LastPass.

                </p>
                <h3>
                    Keeper Overview
                </h3>
                <p>Before going deep towards the comparison with other passwords managers it is necessary to take a
                    quick overview of the best features of the Keeper.
                    <br> <br> Keeper is the dual-type password manager. It supports Cloud-based as well as SSO.
                    <br> <br>First of all, we need to install the keeper extension in our browser for Chrome user <a
                        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keeper%C2%AE-password-manager/bfogiafebfohielmmehodmfbbebbbpei?hl=en-GB">
                        Keeper extension</a>

                </p>
                <h5>Create Records:</h5>
                <p>Keeper allows to SSO login and helps the user to create accounts using a single one master password.
                    Click on the extension and login with the email and password used to create an account on the
                    keeper. Then click on the form and it asks the user to create an account with the password generated
                    by the keeper. And it is easy to refill the password because all the passwords are saved on a
                    keeper.
                </p>
                <h5>Import Existing Record: </h5>
                <p>The best features of the keeper are that it provides a vault to save files and passwords in it. Users
                    can easily save the passwords in the file format by importing the file. Keepers Vault allows the
                    user to import the passwords from other password managers and CSV files downloaded on the computer.
                    Users can also save passwords in the file easily to the vault.
                    <br> Steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
